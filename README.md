# DsmrP1CustomSensor

This is my first custom component for EspHome. It can be used to read DSMR data from the P1 port of dutch smart meters

I haven't tested it because i didn't create a cable yet

The work is based on this project: https://github.com/fliphess/esp8266_p1meter

You can also find there how to create a cable

Just add the .h file in your config folder and see the .yaml file for usage
